#Dougie News

###This is a very simple website I made following the [MEAN stack tutorial](https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial/) on thinkster.io.

The site requires an instance of [mongodb](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) to be running. 

To start the site, clone it to your machine, navigate to the directory it's located in and run `npm start` to start the server, then visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

With Dougie News, you can post links to any website, which will then appear on the main page. All links also have a comment page, where users can post comments. To post links or comments, you must be logged in to an account.
